## 🚀 Featured Projects

These are a few of my favorite and recent projects:

- [**Livechat**](https://github.com/RogerBambinetti/live-chat-nodejs-reactjs): A simple livechat system built with react and node.js, was very useful to learn a bit more about websockets with socket.io.
- [**PROs-scrapper**](project_link): (adding soon).

Thanks for visiting! 😊 Feel free to reach out for a chat about tech (or anything else)
